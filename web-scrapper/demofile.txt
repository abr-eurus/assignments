&#8220;Good health is a gift from God. With Him showering His blessings on me, and with me down here not taking anything for granted and working hard to stay fit, even at 60, I don’t see why I won’t be able to keep winning in bodybuilding competitions even when I am 100 years old,&#8221; Waheed said jokingly.
Waheed won the Mr. Punjab title before being crowned as Mr. Pakistan, and he has set his eyes on the Mr. Asia title next. He revealed that the Mr. Asia competition is likely to be held in India sometime next year, and he is gearing up to win the competition and make a name for his country.
Waheed explained that his lifestyle is very expensive, and he has gone through a lot of hardships in maintaining it.
